Genomics: a revolution in health care?

have a working memory, which lets us keep something in our minds for limited time by repeating it. Whenever you say a phone number to yourself over and over to remember
Drugs affect people differently and we're increasingly understanding why. For many of us, it's down to our genes.
	"The holy grail in health care has long been personalized medicine, or what is now call precision medicine," says Kemal Malik, member of the Bayer board of management 
responsible for innovation. "But getting to the level of precision we wanted wasn't possible until now. What's changed is our ability to sequence the human genome." In
Aprial 2003, the Human Genome Project announced that it had sequenced around 20,000 genes of those that make up the blueprint of our bodies. For 15 years, this medical
breakthrough has been informing and transforming health care. Genomics, the study of genes, is making it possible to predict, diagnose, and treat diseases more precisely
and personally than ever.
	A complete human genome contains three billion base pairs of DNA, uniquely arranged to give us our fundamental anatomy and individual characteristics such as height 
and hair color. DNA forms grnes and understanding their function gives curcial insights into how our bodies work and what happens when we get sick. This was he reasoning 
behind the 13 years and $2.7 billion spent on the Human Genome Project. The world has quickly built on it achievements and now we can map a human sequencing has propelled
genomics into mainstream medicine, driving a revolutionary shift toward precision medicine.
	Early diagnosis of a disease can significantly increase the chances of successful treatment, and genomics can detect a disease long before symptoms present themselves.
Many diseases, including cancers, are caused by aterations in our genes. Genomics can identify these alterations and search for them using an ever-growing number of genetic
tests, many available online. If your results suggest susceptibility toa condtion, you may be able to take preemptive action to delay or even stop the disease developing.
"Health care will move more toward prevention rather than cure," Malik says, and genomics will likely prove an important enabler in understanding the particular healthcare
steps and individual should or should not take.
	When symptoms do develop, genomics can be instrumental in diagnosing the problem. The Human Genome Project has fueled the discovery of nearly 2,000 disease genes, and 
these are proving highly effective at providing fast and accurate analysis. They have been especially valuable for identifying rare genetic diseases that had previously 
taken years to diagnose, ending the uncertainty and suffering of "diagnostic odysseys." Ongoing research is committed to building databases of gentic biomarkers, especially
for cancers. "To date, genomics has had the most impact on cancer," Malik explains, "because we can get tissue, sequence it, and identify the alterations." In the United
States, the Cancer Genome Atlas has mapped the key genomic changes in more than 30 types of cancer. Such databases could deliver a definitive diagnosis in seconds, and
even recommend targeted treatments based on the DNA of noth the patient and the disease.Indeed, genetic sequencing of cancer tumors id helping not only to identify particular
cancers but also to understand what cause them and what could kill them.
	When ti comes to treatment, genomics is driving another important element of precision medicine - pharmacogenomics. "We've long known that the same medication in the same 
dose affects people differently," Malik says. Now we konw why: Our genes influence the production of curcial enzymes in the liver that metabolize medicines. If a genetic
variation stops the enzymes from working properly, the drug can build up in the body with serious side effects. Other drugs onlyu work when broken down in the liver, do if
the enzymes don't , neither does the drug. Such gene compensate for them. Gene variations mean that around 30 percent of people cannot fully convert a commonly used 
anti-clotting drug, but gene testing means alternative drugs can be taken to the same effect.
	There are more than 250 drugs labeled with pharmacogenomic information, enabling them to be prescribed  based on a patient's genetics. As the number grows, and  as DNA
sequencing becomes standard, it's likely that medicines will be routinely prescribed based on our genes - minimizing harmful side effects and making treatments faster and
more effective. "Genomics is even changing the way we develop drugs," Malik says. "It's much more sophisticated because we can find a specific alteration that is causing 
a disease and try to target a medicine specifically to that alternation." In 2014 eight out of the 41 new drugs approved by the FDA were targeted therapies. "Traditionall,
health care's approach has been a bit general," Malik says. "Now we can look at a disease on a personal level."
	Nowhere is this more palpable than in the emerging field of gene editing, a technique that see scientists change the DNA of lining organisms. "Seldom does medicine really
get to cure prople," Malik says. "But if the underlying problem is a particular gene alteration and we can snip that alteration out, then we've shifted from treating to 
curing." A key technology behind gene enditing is CRISPR-Cas9. Based on a defense mechanism found in bacteria, the Cas9 enzyme, described by Malik as "molecular scissor," 
is delivered to a precise segment of malfuctioning DNA, cuts it out, and replaces it with good DNA created in lab. Already in clinical trails, gene editing is becoming a fast,
effective, and increasingly affordable treatment. "This is the ultimate precision medicine," he says. "It has huge potential." 
	In the 15 years since sequencing the first human genome, medicine has been quick to put its learnings int action. Genomics is providing us with a human instrument 
manual that is showing us how to fix ourselves. "In the future we'll see every cancer patient sequenced,  and we'll develop specific drugs to target their particular gentic 
alteration," Malik suggests. With DNA sequencing "We're moving very , very rapidly," he says. Genomics is putting the patient the rather than the disease an the heart of health
care, with a shift form treatments to cures. "It's revolutionizing people's ideas not just of health care," Malik says, "but of illness itself."
